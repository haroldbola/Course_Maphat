Images are a very unique example of high dimensional data. There are, indeed, many dimensions - even for low-resolution images (let's say, 32x32 pixels), while regarding each pixel as a feature, you can end up with hundreds of features. Such large vectors are, generally speaking, hard to visualize, but images make it all much easier, you can just draw the image. We will use this nice property to explore our networks. ```\n","\n","~```Ittai Haran```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"31pDvsmNTpQM","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Examining CNNs"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rkaP3y-JTpQO","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"outputId":"5e366966-8e62-407c-acda-db3f801cb5d8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1558273641934,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1779,"user":{"displayName":"Roee Hendel","photoUrl":"","userId":"17719268639106716158"}}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from keras.layers import Dense, Input, Conv2D, Flatten, MaxPool2D, Dropout, Softmax\n","from keras.models import Model\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Using TensorFlow backend.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YMzOcEmVTpQa","colab_type":"text"},"source":["```As you recall, you used before the MNIST dataset.
