    "In this exercise we will develop an in depth understanding of the defensive distillation defense method against adversarial examples.\n",
    "Start by reading about this method - how does it work, what is the idea behind it etc.\n",
    "Be prepared to discuss this in depth with your instructor\n",
    "\n",
    "** you do **not** need to keep the notebook in this order just make sure that you preform all the needed sections and keep a good record of any results and conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. train a CNN classifer on MNIST, you are welcome to use the code from the attack exercise\n",
    "2. attack the trained model with FGSM, TGSM, BIM & PGD (you can use the TF only implementation for more efficiency)\n",
    "3. implement the defensive distillation approach and train a new classifier using it\n",
    "4. attack the new classifier with the same attacks as before - did you notice any differences?\n",
    "5. randomly choose 2 classes from the MNIST dataset, and repeat the whole process of training a classifier regulary and with defensive distillation and attacking it\n",
    "6. make 4 plots describing the following regarding your classifiers  \n",
    "    a. you will have 2 plots for each classifier (regular and defensive distil.)  \n",
    "    b. for each classifier one plot will describe logits and one probabilities  \n",
    "    c. each plot will be a 2d-scatter plot describing the logit (or prob) value of one class vs the other, where each point represents an input image  \n",
    "    d. add the line y=x and plot the values for only one class of the Ground Truth  \n",
    "    e. look at the received plots, did the defense method acheive it's goal?  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**BONUS** repeat the process for a regular classifier with a high temperature, where the results similar or different? how so?"
