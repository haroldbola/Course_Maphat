Try doing the exercise without help (start from the ipynb file).
If you do need help, use google and friends from the MADOR.
If you're still stuck, double click on 'FolderLocker.bat' to reveal a hidden
folder with the answers.
The password can be found in the same batch file (open first in edit mode).
You may have to dig a bit =]

When you're finished with the answers, please double click again on the
batch file to hide the folder again.

Yours truly, Philip and Gal
